The DALI project:

http://www.dali-ambiguity.org

is concerned with the development of Games-with-a-Purpose to collect data about anaphora/coreference, and in particular about disagreements about anaphoric interpretation; and the use of the collected data to develop new NLP models of anaphoric interpretation and to learn about anaphoric ambiguity. 

DALI is funded by  ERC DALI and is a collaboration between Queen Mary University, the  University of Essex, Columbia University (Bob Carpenter) and the Linguistic Data Consortium.
